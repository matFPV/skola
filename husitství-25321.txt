		Husitstv√≠
Jan Hus was a preacher who opposed the
current state of religion and wanted
equality between the preachers and
the normal people. He wanted the
other preachers to do as they say and
live simpler lives the way they
tought the people to do. He disliked
that the people running religion were
making money by providing a way for 
the people to "erase their sin" and
"be forgiven by god". Because he
was bringing knowledge about this
to the masses he was sentenced 
to death by burning.
